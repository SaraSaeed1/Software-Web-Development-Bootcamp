# Pokemon API

Using the previous lesson as a starting point, create a React project that simply has a button with the text "Fetch Pokemon".

When this is clicked, output the names of all 807 Pokemon using the [Pokemon API. ](https://pokeapi.co)

To use the code
- create a new react app called ``pokemon_api `` 

```
npx create-react-app pokemon_api
```

and then replace the ``src`` folder with [this folder](https://github.com/SaraSaeed1/Software-Web-Development-Bootcamp/tree/main/MERN_stack/React/Pokemon/src)
