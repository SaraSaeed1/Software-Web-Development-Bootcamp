### Assignment: Semi-Restful TV Shows Validated

**Objectives:**

- Practice validating data before entering it into the database
#

Let's add validations to your existing Semi-Restful TV Shows assignment! Building off of your existing assignment, implement the validations indicated on the green sticky notes to prevent dirty data from getting into your database. If a submission is invalid, display errors on the appropriate page.
