- [x] Add a template to your app

- [x] Add a route that renders this template and have it display a list of all the dojos and their associated ninjas

- [x] Add a route to process the creation of a new dojo

- [x] Add a route to process the creation of a new ninja; the dropdown on the form should be a list of all existing dojos

- [x] NINJA BONUS: Add a delete button next to each dojo name that deletes that dojo (and all associated ninjas) from the database

- [x] SENSEI BONUS: Add a count of ninjas next to each dojo name (eg. Ninjas at the Painting Dojo - 2; Ninjas at the Architecture Dojo - 0)
