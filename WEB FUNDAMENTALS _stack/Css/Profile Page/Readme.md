**Objectives:**

- Use what we've learned about CSS to recreate the following website.

This is a tricky assignment, let's make sure we build in layers working from the top down and from the outside to the inside.

This assignment may take us upwards of 4 hours to complete, this is normal as CSS can be time consuming. _We strongly suggest working in groups_, pair programming is a common programming practice.
